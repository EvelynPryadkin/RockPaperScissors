# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python. It allows a user to play against the computer in a text-based format, with score tracking and input validation.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts user input (rock, paper, or scissors)
- Randomly generates the computer's choice
- Compares choices and determines the winner
- Tracks:
  - User wins
  - Computer wins
  - Ties
- Repeats rounds until the user chooses to stop
- Validates input for both game choices and replay

## 💡 What You Learn from This

- `input()` and user interaction
- `random.choice()` for computer decision-making
- `if/elif/else` logic
- `while True` and loops
- Score tracking with variables
- Basic input validation
